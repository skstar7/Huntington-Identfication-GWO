1. Introduction
	Biclustering is a powerful technique to clustering rows and columns in the form of a matrix data set , co-expressed under a subset of all the samples of the genes which have the similar kind of characteristics with few conditions in the microarray gene expression dataset . As it is a very complex problem, here meta-heuristic algorithms are very much accurate for getting optimal solutions by exploring a large number of datasets .
	In microarrays, thousands of genes are simultaneously measured in the laboratory .
	Huntington disease is a condition inherited from parents in that brain nerve cells degenerate over time. This condition is caused by a single gene mutation. It is an autosomal dominant disorder, that is, it only requires one non typical gene to develop the disorder. Apart from genes in the sex chromosomes , one person gets two copies of the whole gene , one each from each parent. Parents with genetic disorders can give their child a disorder or healthy genes . So a child has a fifty percent chance of having this genetic disorder . This Huntington’s disease symptoms can appear at any time . But, it often appears in the ages between 30s to 40s . It can cause a wide range of movement, cognitive, and psychiatric disorders. Walking, thinking, swallowing, and speaking become difficult.
The method used here is Grey Wolf Optimization .GWO is a meta-heuristic algorithm which is based on the living hierarchy of grey wolves.Mathematical optimization and computer science define metaheuristics as heuristics provide the possibility of a sufficient optimization solution .
